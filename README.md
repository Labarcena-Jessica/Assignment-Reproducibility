# Assignment-Reproducibility
This project is part of the assignment for the Productivity and Reproducibility in Ecology course. This is part of a study focused on generating species range polygons using occurrence records to implement in a pipeline for cleaning/assessing quality control of telemetry data in marine fishes. 
We developed a pipeline that uses occurrence records to generate range polygons. We first explored different data repositories and downloaded the data for the species of interest. We finally map the polygons and compare the quality to polygons generated with data of reference. 

This repository contains the code for reproducing the study.
